Title: Direct and indirect interactions with Graphical Modelling
LinkingTo: Rcpp
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Robert Stojnic
Description: Distinguish direct from indirect interactions in gene
    regulation and infer combinatorial code from highly correlated
    variables such as transcription factor binding profiles. The
    package implements the Neigbhourhood Consistent PC algorithm (NCPC)
    and draws Direct Dependence Graphs to represent dependence
    structure around a target variable. The package also provides a
    unified interface to other Graphical Modelling (Bayesian Network)
    packages for distinguishing direct and indirect interactions.
