Title: Distinguish direct and indirect interactions with Graphical
        Modelling
LinkingTo: Rcpp
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Robert Stojnic
Description: Distinguish direct from indirect interactions in gene
        regulation and infer combinatorial code from highly correlated
        variables such as transcription factor binding profiles. The
        package implements the Neighbourhood Consistent PC algorithm
        (NCPC) and draws Direct Dependence Graphs to represent
        dependence structure around a target variable. The package also
        provides a unified interface to other Graphical Modelling
        (Bayesian Network) packages for distinguishing direct and
        indirect interactions.
